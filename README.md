# Task 1: Develop a basic text-based game.

## Objective: Implement a simple game using
conditional statements for game logic.

### Steps:
1. Choose a game type (quiz, guessing game).

2. Define the game rules and logic.

3. Use conditional statements to manage game flow.

4. Test and debug the game for correctness

   

# Task 2: Generate and print simple number patterns.

## Objective: Utilize loops to control the structure of number patterns.

### Steps:

1. Select a number pattern type (e.g.,
pyramid).

2. Develop a program to generate the
selected pattern.

3. Use loops to control the structure of the
pattern.

4. Verify the correctness of the generate
pattern.


# Task 3: Create a console application for basic CRUD operations on a list
of tasks.

# Objective: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using arrays or lists for data storage.

# Steps:

1. Define a Task class with necessary attributes.

2. Implement functionality to create a new task.

3. Develop a method to read and display tasks.

4. Allow users to update task details.

5. Provide an option to delete tasks.

6. Test the application with various scenarios.


# Task 4: Build a temperature
converter program.

# Objective: Enable users to input temperatures
and choose the conversion direction between
Fahrenheit and Celsius.

# Steps:
1. Design a program to accept temperature
input.

2. Implement logic for temperature conversion.
  
3. Allow users to choose the conversion
direction.
4. Test the program with different input values
